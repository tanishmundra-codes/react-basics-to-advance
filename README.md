# ⚛️ React Basics to Advanced

## 📍 The Process

Started this repo to document my React learning journey. Instead of just watching tutorials, I turned each topic into a working project. From handling props and lifting state up to managing effects and building reusable components this repo reflects the actual steps I took to go from basics to more confident React development.
